# Usage

After installing and enabling the extension, type `! <bang> <query>` in your browser's search bar and press enter. The extension will take you to your destination.

# Key Benefits

* Instant: No network delay while you type. Suggestions and query resolution happen locally.
* No DNS lookups during query composition: the browser doesn't touch the network until you press Enter.
* Don't memorize bangs: type-ahead suggestions surface the right bang as you type.
* Fully local resolution: the final URL is built inside the extension - no extra hops or redirects.
* Privacy-first: no telemetry, no background requests - only the final navigation is performed.
