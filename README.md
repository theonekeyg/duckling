# Installation

2. Click on "Add to Chrome".
3. Enable the extension.

## Load unpacked extension from source

1. Open Chrome extensions page (chrome://extensions/).
2. Enable "Developer mode" in top right.
3. Click on "Load unpacked" in the top left and select the directory of the cloned repo.

# Usage

1. In the search bar, type "! " (exclamation mark, then space)
2. Start typing a bang (e.g. gh, so, npm, wiki) and pick from live suggestions.
3. Add your query and press Enter to jump directly to target site.

# Key Benefits

* Instant: No network delay while you type. Suggestions and query resolution happen locally.
* No DNS lookups during query composition: the browser doesn't touch the network until you press Enter.
* Don't memorize bangs: type-ahead suggestions surface the right bang as you type.
* Fully local resolution: the final URL is built inside the extension - no extra hops or redirects.
* Privacy-first: no telemetry, no background requests - only the final navigation is performed.
